# data-collection-pipeline

This repo contains the code for a general purpose web-scraper. This is managed by the scripts data_handling.py and general_web_scraping.py.
There is an example of a specific web-scraper that scrapes the website az-animals by calling the configuration file.

The web-scraper runs using the BeautifulSoup library, which makes it faster than Selenium based web-scrapers.

This README will be massively improved very soon!

I will soon also add improved project structure, unit-testing, more examples to prove the generality of the web-scraper, a requirements.txt and docker containerisation.
